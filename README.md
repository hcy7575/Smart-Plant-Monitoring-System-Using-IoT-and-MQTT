Smart Plant Monitoring System Using IoT and MQTT

Developed an IoT-based plant monitoring system utilizing the MQTT protocol for real-time data transmission. Integrated BH1750 (light sensor), DHT22 (temperature & humidity sensor), ESP32 camera module, and matrix sensors to track environmental conditions. Used Raspberry Pi as the central hub for processing and managing sensor communication. The system enables real-time monitoring of plant health through sensor data and visual analysis, ensuring optimal growing conditions.
